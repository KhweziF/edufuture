      <h3>Bridging the Educational Divide</h3>
      <p>
        EduFuture South Africa is a registered non-profit organisation committed to breaking the cycle of poverty through education. We believe that every child, regardless of their socio-economic background, deserves access to quality learning resources and supportive mentorship to reach their full potential. Founded in 2020, we work directly with schools and communities in townships and rural areas to create lasting change.
